// watchdog.go runs the credits-preserve watchdog — every interval (default
// 10 minutes) it pulls fresh credits for every qoderwork account and flips
// the preserve flag on disk when an account's remaining credits drop below
// the configured threshold (default 50).
//
// Why a watchdog instead of event-driven only: scheduler.pick only reads the
// cached credits snapshot. Without a periodic refresh, an account can sit at
// remain=49 in the cache forever even though the user manually recharged it
// via the qoderwork web UI. The watchdog closes that gap — every interval it
// hits /v2/quota/usage through cachedAccountDetails (which already
// singleflight-dedups concurrent dashboard fetches), then decides whether
// the account needs to be parked in the preserve set so routing stops
// burning its remaining credits.
//
// Trigger sources (three entry points converge on this goroutine):
//   1. Periodic tick — every preserveWatchdogInterval.
//   2. configure()    — register / reconfigure drops a non-blocking tick.
//   3. Panel force    — buildDashboardEx(force=true) reuses the already-fetched
//                       credits from the dashboard pass to flip flags synchronously,
//                       so the same panel response shows correct badges without
//                       waiting the next interval.
//
// All three are idempotent and best-effort: a tick that finds nothing to
// flip just exits.
//
// Lifecycle: the loop is started in init() and runs forever. config-driven
// enable/disable is checked every iteration so we never need to restart the
// goroutine (the plugin shutdown path is a no-op due to SIGSEGV risk from
// touching Go sync primitives during host teardown — see main.go shutdown).
//
// First-tick race (v0.12.1 fix): init() runs *before* cliproxy_plugin_init
// sets hostAPI. An immediate first tick raced against hostAuthList() and
// returned silently on the very first run, leaving a 10-minute blind window
// where accounts below threshold were not yet flagged. Now the loop waits
// for hostReadyForWatchdog() (host bridge up AND auth discovery alive) up to
// preserveWatchdogStartupWait before firing its first tick. requestPreserveTick
// further coalesces configure() triggers into the same batch.
